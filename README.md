# Robotic -ML
# The aim of this prpject is to move the robot around the arena
# in such a way as to generate an occupancy grid map of the arena
# itself.  Full details can be found in the controller codes 
#
# This controller file simply creates a controller and initialises
# the occupancy grid class.  You will need to complete the code in
# the occupancy grid class to implement the inverse sensor model
# and complete the update method.
#
# Note that the size of the occupancy grid can be changed (see below)
# as well as the update frequency of the map, and whether or not a
# map is generated. Changing these values may be useful during the
# debugging phase, but ensure that the solution you submit generates
# an occupancy grid map of size 100x100 cells.
#
# Note that this class makes the following assumptions:
#
#	PioneerCLNav
#	============
#	You have a navigator class called PioneerCLNav that implements
#	the following methods (based on Lab Tutorial 6):
#	  - a constructor that takes two arguments, an instance of a Supervisor
#	    robot object and an instance of a PioneerSimpleProxSensors
#	  - set_goal() which defines a destination pose
#	  - update() that makes any changes necessary as part of navigation
#	You can replace these with other calls if you want to use a different
#	class or means of navigation.  Note this is NOT included.
#	Note - if you use a different class you must implement a method called
#	get_real_pose() that returns an object of type Pose representing the true
#	location of the robot.  Examples of this class are used in Lab Tutorials 3 and 6.
#
#	PioneerSimpleProxSensors
#	========================
#	You have a sensor class based on the work in Lab 5.  This is used by
#	navigator class, but could also be used by a navigator class.  Code
#	for the version used in the tutorial is included with the assignment.
#
#	Pose
#	====
#	This is the latest version of the Pose class (it includes some additional
#	methods used in Lab Tutorial 6), and is used throughout the COMP329
#	code base.  A version is included with the assignment.
#
#	OccupancyGrid
#	=============
#	You have an occupancy grid class.  The constructor takes the following
#	arguments:
#	  - an instance of a Supervisor robot object
#	  - the number of cells per meter.  The higher the number, the higher
#	    the resolution of the map.  I recommend between 5-20.
#	  - the name of the display object on the robot where the map appears
#	  - the initial pose of the robot
#	  - an instance of the PioneerSimpleProxSensors object
#
#	To update the occupancy grid, call the map() method with the current Pose
#	To draw the occupancy grid, call the paint() method
#
